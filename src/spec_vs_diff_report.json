  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented via a new global ScrollToTop component wired into the App layout. REQ-2 likely implemented in Footer, but the diff for the Contact section is truncated so exact-string compliance cannot be fully verified from provided excerpts. Additionally, an immutable auth hook file was modified (disallowed by constraints), and a project_state.json metadata file was added though not requested.",
