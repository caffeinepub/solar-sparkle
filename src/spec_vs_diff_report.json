However, the diff does not show the required PNG assets being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and several unrelated UI/content/style enhancements appear to have been introduced beyond swapping logo assets.",

      "reason": "The diff only adds TypeScript constants that reference the new image filenames, but does not show any actual PNG image files being created/added (and the diff summary is LLM-readable files only).

      "reason": "Although code references /assets/generated/... paths, the diff does not show any files added under frontend/public/assets/generated, so there is no evidence the static assets were actually added to the repo at the required location.",
